At first I have inserted 2D convolution 1 layer with 16 filters by kernel (3, 3), pool size by (2, 2), then flatten to traditional nueral network. In traditonal neural network I inserted 1 hidden layer with 64 units and dropout with 0.3 rate value, I compiled model optimizer 'Adam' algorithm, loss binary_crossentropy function and mertics as accuracy class. After training model with 10 epochs and evaluating nueral network performance, I got 0.9940 accuracy with 0.0193 loss.
At Last, I have doubled first try values as; inserted 2D convolution 1 layer with 32 filters, inserted 2 hidden layers with each 128 units and dropout with 0.6 rate value. Then I have run the program a couple of times and each time got result 1 accuracy with significantly minor loss. Means, When I increased the convolution layer filters, hidden layer numbers and including units within the layers leads the result become more accurate.
